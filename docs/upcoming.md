# !!This list should be converted as tasks/issues once template docs and guidelines are completed.

### Refactoring To Do:

[ ] migrate issue/task management ! (MAYBE) we could just use GitHub issues & docs or use linear.app.

[ ] have develop branch, create new branch for the new version of the app and structure.

[ ] Context implementation.

[ ] Better Layout integration + using semantic html tags.

[ ] lazy loading JSX files/modules and !!images!!

[ ] storing each component visibility status. e.g. :

● -1 : show + not working properly, by changing their style/clickability
● 0 : hide + disabled.
● 1 : show + working properly.

[ ] ESlint config

[ ] Pull request template for docs

[ ] Issues/tasks templates for docs

[ ] add trello tasks here

### Future Features To do

[ ] hover on div/component to show file or component name

[ ] documnetation on how to use the project
